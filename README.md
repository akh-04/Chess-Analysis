Statistical Analysis for Chess Games

Cheating in chess is when a player or team intentionally breaks the game’s rules or engages in other activities to give them an unfair advantage. Using an outside tool to simulate movements is considered cheating. Players use apps like Stockfish, Lila, and Alpha 0 to get ready for their games. The use of the program while playing games is also permitted, which is regarded as cheating. A Grand Master-level player only has to be aware of whether the board’s present position is balanced or not to influence games in their favor.
