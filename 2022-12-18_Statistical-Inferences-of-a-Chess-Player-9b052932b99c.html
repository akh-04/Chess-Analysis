Niemann moved up quickly in the world of chess. It took him only four years after his first rated match, in which he got a provisional US Chess rating of 1122, to become a FIDE master. Then, in 2018 and 2021, respectively, Niemann received his international master and grandmaster titles. He won the U.S. Junior Championship in July 2021.</p><p name="0849" id="0849" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Niemann was invited to the 2022 Sinquefield Cup after his ranking rose over the year. In round three, Niemann beat GM Magnus Carlsen with the black pieces. This gave him a live rating of 2700 and a score of 2.5/3 in the competition. But Carlsen suddenly dropped out of the competition just before the next round, without giving an official reason. After Carlsen dropped out, there was a lot of talk about how Niemann’s recent results in the Sinquefield Cup and other tournaments may have been unfair. After the competition on September 11, 2022, Niemann’s live rating was 26,98.8.</p><p name="f5aa" id="f5aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While his performance in some of these games is within the bounds of some statistical plausibility, there is very little chance that any one player could have performed so brilliantly in so many games. Theoretically, we explain how Hans Niemann’s gaming stats will be compared to those of other players from different tiers. Before we wrap up, we look at the statistical results of Hans Niemann’s cheating in live and online chess games over the past two years.</p><p name="e014" id="e014" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cheating in chess is when a player or team intentionally breaks the game’s rules or engages in other activities to give them an unfair advantage. Using an outside tool to simulate movements is considered cheating. Players use apps like Stockfish, Lila, and Alpha 0 to get ready for their games. The use of the program while playing games is also permitted, which is regarded as cheating. A Grand Master-level player only has to be aware of whether the board’s present position is balanced or not to influence games in their favor.</p><figure name="272c" id="272c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*rVolHBiBnpeua9YJnbFEDQ.png" data-width="750" data-height="420" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rVolHBiBnpeua9YJnbFEDQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">Hans Niemann</strong></figcaption></figure><h3 name="74e1" id="74e1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">I.

ALGORITHMS</strong></h3><ol class="postList"><li name="38d0" id="38d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Stockfish: </strong>Stockfish uses the alpha-beta pruning search algorithm. Alpha-beta pruning improves minimax search by avoiding variations that will never be reached in optimal play because either player will redirect the game. Since it is often computationally infeasible to search until the end of the game, the search is terminated early when it reaches a certain depth. Search depth is measured by ply, where a ply is a turn taken by a player. A search depth of D indicates that the distance between the root node and the leaf nodes of the search tree is D ply. Stockfish incrementally increases the depth of its search tree in a process known as iterative deepening (Groot, 1978). However, when a nominal search depth of D is reported by chess engines, it does not mean that the search has considered all variations of D moves. This is due to heuristics which cause the engine to search promising variations to a greater depth than nominal and less promising variations to a lesser depth than nominal.</li><li name="e3b7" id="e3b7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Average Centipawn Loss (aCPL)</strong>: Average centipawn loss is the number of hundredths of a pawn by which a player deviated from the most accurate move calculated by a computer. The average centipawn loss (aCPL) is the amount by which a chess engine’s evaluation of the position changes after each of the player’s moves. These values play no formal role in the game but are useful to players, and essential in computer chess, for evaluating positions. The top computer move will lose zero centipawns, but lesser moves will rest deteriorate position, measured in centipawns. This value can be used as an indicator of the quality of play. The fewer centipawns, one loses per move, the stronger the play.</li><li name="9b4e" id="9b4e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Standard Deviation Centipawn Loss (STDCPL):</strong> The standard deviation measures the amount of CPL dispersion. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the CPL, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.</li></ol><h3 name="3f88" id="3f88" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">IV.

He has ACPL around 35 when he reached 2300 which is a bit more when compared to other Super GMs. When we look at the CPL standard deviation, the loss remains in the range of 60 to 40 with playing 10 games with a 100% correlation to stockfish in a Chess.com tournament. The Below graphs show progress from 2300 to 2600, making us moresuspicious of cheating.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="ff2b" id="ff2b" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 50%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dOeo7bb0RH5nHcehkVcrZg.jpeg" data-width="583" data-height="389" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*dOeo7bb0RH5nHcehkVcrZg.jpeg"></figure><figure name="373c" id="373c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 50%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0OmOUc_7NA8OhOmpZ8C8Wg.jpeg" data-width="583" data-height="389" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*0OmOUc_7NA8OhOmpZ8C8Wg.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="2cd7" id="2cd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As we can see, variance in CPL i.e., making errors is somewhat constant, indicating a non-human behavioral pattern in the play style. The data points indicate a very erratic pattern which infers that he sometimes plays at a different level and sometimes plays like a computer. If the error remains constant, then his rating should not have increased but if he has any external help during the game, then a solid statistical inference of cheating can be made.</p><h3 name="c345" id="c345" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">V. CONCLUSION</strong></h3><ul class="postList"><li name="30fe" id="30fe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">There is typically a negative correlation between average centipawn loss and rating. However, Niemann’s games appear to show a different trend: his average centipawn loss increased during some periods of his rating gains.</li><li name="8036" id="8036" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Niemann’s aCPL is around 26 which indicates his rating should be in the 2500s which is not the case and iit’s2700 where his aCPL should be around 20.</li><li name="4e63" id="4e63" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Similarly, his STDCPL is around 48, indicating that his Elo should be around 2500.</li><li name="38dd" id="38dd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Niemann’s aCPL and STDCPL show a linear decrease till 2018, around his 2300 ELO. After 2018 his rating has increased but the aCPL and STDCPL indicate a player with a rating of 2500.</li></ul><h3 name="b30e" id="b30e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">VI.

We do not have any physical evidence to support the fact that Hans had external help but looking at the statistical information and analysis mentioned above. We can observe erratic behavior while playing some games.</p></div></div></section><section name="474b" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5b65" id="5b65" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Copyright 2022<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> Akhilesh Dongre, Jatin Madan, Sreya Vallabhaneni</strong></p><p name="4e8b" id="4e8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this article and associated documentation files, to deal in the article without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the article, and to permit persons to whom the article is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p><p name="e4d0" id="e4d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the article.</p><p name="d556" id="d556" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">THE ARTICLE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
